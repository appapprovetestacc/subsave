# Help center for SubSave

## Common setup issues

- Missing shop parameter: open the app from Shopify admin.
- Billing inactive: Choose the recurring subscription test plan in /billing before using paid features.
- If setup is blocked: Open the app from Shopify admin so the embedded App Bridge session is established.
- If setup is blocked: Complete the admin dashboard setup and save settings before testing storefront or webhook behavior.
- Webhook issue: check /status and AppApprove deployment logs; every webhook must verify HMAC before processing.
